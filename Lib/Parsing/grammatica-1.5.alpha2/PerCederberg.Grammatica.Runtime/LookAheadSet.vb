' * A token look-ahead set. This class contains a set of token id 
' * sequences. All sequences in the set are limited in length, so 
' * that no single sequence is longer than a maximum value. This 
' * class also filters out duplicates. Each token sequence also 
' * contains a repeat flag, allowing the look-ahead set to contain 
' * information about possible infinite repetitions of certain 
' * sequences. That information is important when conflicts arise 
' * between two look-ahead sets, as such a conflict cannot be 
' * resolved if the conflicting sequences can be repeated (would 
' * cause infinite loop).
