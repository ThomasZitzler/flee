    '* 
' * A look-ahead character stream reader. This class provides the 
' * functionalities of a buffered line-number reader, but with the 
' * additional possibility of peeking an unlimited number of 
' * characters ahead. When looking further and further ahead in the 
' * character stream, the buffer is continously enlarged to contain 
' * all the required characters from the current position an 
' * onwards. This means that looking more characters ahead requires 
' * more memory, and thus becomes unviable in the end.
